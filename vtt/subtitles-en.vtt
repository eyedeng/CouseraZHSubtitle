00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Hello and welcome to this course

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.425
on Kotlin advanced programming.

3
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.255
As an aspiring developer,

4
00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:08.160
you may have some
existing knowledge

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.515
and skills in Android
app development.

6
00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:11.910
This course will help you

7
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.025
advance your app
development level by

8
00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:15.990
introducing you to
the finer points

9
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.910
of Kotlin code and concepts,

10
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.500
you will probably agree that

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.150
there's an app for everything.

12
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.100
However, it's important
to realize that

13
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.320
there isn't a great
app for everything.

14
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.560
The all-important metric
of user experience is

15
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.240
determined by excellent design

16
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.610
coupled with solid
software development.

17
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.395
To achieve such excellence,

18
00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:36.420
it's vital to continually grow

19
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.315
your mastery of the Kotlin
programming language.

20
00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:42.025
In this advanced programming
in Kotlin course,

21
00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:43.460
you will expand your Kotlin

22
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.140
programming knowledge
so that you can

23
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.550
engineer better solutions
when building Android apps.

24
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.150
Kotlin is an open-source
language with

25
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.400
an Apache 2 license and is
available free of charge.

26
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.960
It is used daily
and worldwide by

27
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.210
large and small organizations

28
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.745
to produce many
different types of apps.

29
00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:04.805
To do advanced app
development work with Kotlin,

30
00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:06.815
you should have a good
working knowledge

31
00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:08.450
of programming fundamentals.

32
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.340
Be familiar with the concepts of

33
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
user experience and
user interface design,

34
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.010
and be able to create
user interfaces in

35
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.115
Android Studio to assist
with your learning,

36
00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:20.510
you will view and work on

37
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.015
development tasks for the
fictitious Restaurant,

38
00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.995
Little Lemon, where
you will encounter

39
00:01:24.995 --> 00:01:27.620
many real-world scenarios with

40
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.200
your newly upscaled
Kotlin knowledge,

41
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.120
you will work through
these scenarios,

42
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.285
overcoming challenges and
implementing solutions.

43
00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:37.175
As your skill set grows,

44
00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:40.100
you will focus on many
Kotlin language tools,

45
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.710
why you need them and
how they are used.

46
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.585
In this course introduction,

47
00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:46.730
you may encounter
some new terms,

48
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.230
but don't worry if you don't

49
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.030
fully understand all of them.

50
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.770
During the course,
you'll explore

51
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.585
these concepts in more detail

52
00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:55.250
along with the core
skills that are

53
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.920
required during app
development with Kotlin.

54
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.140
This course consists of
four weeks of learning.

55
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.525
By the end of this course,

56
00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:05.030
you should have acquired the
skills and knowledge with

57
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.010
the necessary tools to complete

58
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.295
the end-of-course
Android project.

59
00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.810
Let's break down the
content you will cover in

60
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.990
each week of this advanced
programming in Kotlin course.

61
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.480
Week 1 covers the
key features of

62
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.150
Kotlin and Android and
how they interact.

63
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.770
After your studies this week,

64
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.590
you will be able to
explain how to use

65
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.010
inheritance to decide how
a component should behave.

66
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.070
Implement an application
with an activity,

67
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.230
implement a list adapter,

68
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.890
and declare an
object in Android.

69
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.675
Create a new static
inner classes

70
00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:40.880
and inner modifiers
when appropriate,

71
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.675
set and read activity arguments,

72
00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:46.040
and implement a companion object

73
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.490
with constant values
and arguments.

74
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.050
Week 2 explores advanced
object-oriented features.

75
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.630
You will advance your skills

76
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.310
during this week to be able to

77
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.350
use an extension function to add

78
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.510
a method to a class
when appropriate.

79
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.519
Explain a testing methodology

80
00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.724
called test-driven development,

81
00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:05.450
lists the main features of

82
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.865
test-driven development or TDD,

83
00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:10.925
and explain the purpose
and types of testing.

84
00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:14.255
Use mocks and fakes for
unit testing in Android,

85
00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:18.190
and define and use a generic
class to solve a problem.

86
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.015
Week 3 covers
functional programming.

87
00:03:21.015 --> 00:03:23.990
You'll cover what it is
and why it's useful?

88
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.035
In addition, you'll work
with functions in Kotlin.

89
00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:29.330
After successfully
completing this week,

90
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.340
you'll be able to explain what

91
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.040
functional programming
is and why it's useful.

92
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.560
Read and define a function type.

93
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.650
Use a lambda expression
to define a function as

94
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.480
an object and define

95
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.495
a function that takes a
function as an argument.

96
00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:46.670
Use collection
processing functions

97
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.110
to process collections in

98
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.790
different ways and use

99
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.620
collection processing
methods from

100
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.830
multi-step collection
processing.

101
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.400
In this final week,

102
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.980
you will complete a
practical development task,

103
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.440
which will synthesize
the concepts

104
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.210
and skills from this course to

105
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.950
create a list with filtering and

106
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.655
sorting in the final app
development project,

107
00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:08.510
and allow you to reflect on

108
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.985
the next steps in the
learning journey.

109
00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:13.625
The advanced programming
in Kotlin course

110
00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:17.210
introduces you to many
software engineering concepts.

111
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.480
These will help you to
build a better Android app.

112
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.580
Engineering excellence is not

113
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.905
simply about what works
well on the surface,

114
00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:27.860
but also about everything
that is happening within.

115
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.390
Your programming skills and

116
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.520
approach to creating
code solutions are

117
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.545
the most important
success factors

118
00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:35.485
when it comes to
app development.

119
00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:37.400
I look forward to
helping you build

120
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.080
the advanced
programming skills you

121
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.330
need to get to the next level.

122
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.270
Wishing you all the best on
your Kotlin learning journey.
